"""Global configuration.

The UI was originally authored for a 1920x720 logical canvas. The target
hardware now uses 1280x480 (same 8:3 aspect). To avoid handâ€‘editing every
pixel constant we keep the original design resolution (DESIGN_WIDTH/HEIGHT)
and scale the whole scene uniformly to the target (WIDTH/HEIGHT).

Any new hard pixel values added in QML should normally refer to the logical
design coordinate system (DESIGN_*), so they will scale automatically.
